# OpenAIRE Plugin 2.0

About
-----

This plugin adds a new OAI-PMH metadataformat that supports OpenAIRE Guidelines for Literature Repository Managers v4 (https://openaire-guidelines-for-literature-repository-managers.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/). The metadataformat uses JATS XML format.

In section settings journals can choose a COAR Resource Type that best describes the articles published in that section (https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/deliverables/).

The article access rights are shown by using the COAR Access Rights Vocabulary (https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/access-rights-vocabulary/).

The OpenAIRE OAI metadaformat also contains a hook that can be used to inject funding data to the article entry. This means that journals can use any source of funding data they want. Funding Plugin for OJS3 supports this hook (https://github.com/ajnyga/funding).

The plugin has been developed in cooperation with OpenAIRE.
